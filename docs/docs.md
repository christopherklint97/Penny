# What is Penny?

Penny is a travel planner that integrates with Facebook through Oauth, Google Maps through the Places and Maps API, and Open Weather API.

## Important note

Since the Facebook login is in development mode, I need to add you as a user in order for you to access the live version of the app. Please reach out and I will give you access!

## How to use Penny?

Once you login, users create trips centered around cities that they would like to travel to. You can then add different places that want to visit in these trips.

Just login with Facebook and have a ball!
